Welcome! 

Hi group,
I have made a book down project that we can make and publish for the course materials
for kriminology should we wish. With this repository we can add toy datasets to use in 
teaching if we wish, and build up the book little by little. As it stands now, 
its just the tutorial material one receives from R on how to build a bookdown site.
I have changed a couple file names and headings to show how it could start to look a little
This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your book. 

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.
