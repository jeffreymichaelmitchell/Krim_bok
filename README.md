Welcome! 

Hi group,
Now the bookdown project has some content in there, and I have added two toy data
sets for the students. One is the toy NTU data that has been used in the B course and
the other is a toy dataset I have made from several datasources that is at the 
l√§n level. As it is now there is content that shows them how to download R, install 
packages, do a little univariate and bivariate analysis. I have not edited the texts well
so there are bound to be tons of typos, grammar errors etc.
